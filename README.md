[Relate to the user]
Let me guess, 
•	You are paying way more for website than it’s worth.
•	You are running out of money paying for a design that goes nowhere
•	You might be losing customer respect
•	You can’t afford to hire a copywriter, SEO expert and developer

[Value proposition]
I understand exactly what you’re going through. Starting a business is fun and exciting till you see the total costs you need to spend. Sometimes you just want to give up when you think of those movies on tv about businesses going wrong.
That doesn’t have to be you. Hiring a SEO expert could cost you 100 $ per hour, while a copywriter could cost you 50 $ per hour and let’s not forget the developer fee which costs 200 $ per hour. Put it all together and you have umm. Way more than a new business owner could possibly afford! SO if you have these handled, you could have a massive chance at having success and stand out among new business owners and save a lot of time as well.

How cool would it be to have one person to do all three of these skills and save a lot of money as well?
